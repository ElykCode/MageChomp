# MageChomp

MageChomp is a program that reads and displays the file signature (magic bytes) of a given file. It will ask you for a file and then display a textual representation of the first few bytes of that file. This can be used to identify the type of file, regardless of the file name (you don't need to trust the file extension).

## TO-DO

1) Add more contextual informational text to the existing program
2) Match the magic bytes of the file against known file types
3) Add a CLI-based program
